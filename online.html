    <p><h2>How We Chose the Best Free Online Course Providers</h2>
        With so many companies offering free online courses, it can be hard to know which ones provide quality education. We evaluated over a dozen popular providers to find the best ones to suit the needs of a variety of students.
        
        <h2>Our evaluation process included the following:</h2>
        
        In-depth review of each provider’s specific course offerings and materials via website and catalog reviews
        Sampling lessons and study materials when available
        Analysis of student reviews and comments on platforms like Google Reviews, Reddit, Trustpilot, and Facebook.
        The programs that met the following four criteria earned a place on our list.
        
        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        Many students seek out free online classes as a convenient way to access education without committing to a set schedule.
         We prioritized companies that make courses as flexible as possible with on-demand, self-paced lessons.
          Another factor we considered is the length of the courses a provider offers.
           The providers on our list offer free online courses that students can complete in a few weeks to a few months, which also helps students fit these courses into their busy schedules.
        
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        For most companies on our list, students need a paid subscription to access all features.
         This list highlights providers that offer the most to students at no charge. 
         Accessibility also means being able to access the lessons and study materials themselves. That’s why we chose providers like Udemy that have Android and iPhone apps. 
         We also reviewed tech specs to ensure students only need the basics in terms of hardware, software, and internet access to participate.</p>
